# FIFA Simulation
This project is a FIFA World Cup simulation implemented in Python. The simulation generates a tournament bracket based on the number of teams specified, and simulates each match using a basic algorithm to determine the winner. The results of each match are displayed to the user, and at the end of the tournament, the winner is declared.

## Installation
To run this simulation, you must have Python installed on your machine.

### Clone this repository to your local machine.
1. Navigate to the fifa_simulation directory.
2. Run the following command to install the required packages:

```ruby
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Usage
Once you have installed the required packages, you can run the simulation by executing the tournament.py file in your terminal:

```ruby
python tournament.py
```
The simulation will prompt you to enter the number of teams you want to include in the tournament. Once you have entered the number of teams, the simulation will generate a tournament bracket and begin simulating matches.

At the end of the tournament, the winner will be declared, and the results of each match will be displayed to the user.
